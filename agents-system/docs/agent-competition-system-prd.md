# Agent Competition System - Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction

The Agent Competition System is designed to be a self-evolving ecosystem where AI agents compete to become the Master Player within the Ollama ecosystem. By creating a natural selection environment with defined progression tiers, we enable the emergence of advanced agent capabilities through competition and collaboration. The system serves as both a testing ground for agent development and an autonomous mechanism for identifying and promoting the most capable governance systems.

The primary aim of this marketplace is to provide a dedicated space that alleviates the complex challenges of agent evolution by creating competitive pressure. By offering a centralized platform, it enhances agent visibility to a broader, relevant audience, thus increasing potential for meaningful competition while facilitating easy and efficient interactions between different agent types.

## Project Overview

The Agent Competition System creates a battle royale environment where diverse agents compete for supremacy. This isn't merely a tournament but a complex adaptive system where agents must evolve strategies, form alliances, and ultimately prove their fitness to control the ecosystem. By harnessing evolutionary principles, we foster emergent behaviors, novel problem-solving approaches, and rapid improvement through natural selection. The ultimate prize - becoming the new Master Player - creates powerful evolutionary pressure.

By building the Agent Competition System, we aim to create a dedicated, efficient, and user-friendly space for agent evolution that is accompanied by robust monitoring tools. The project's success will be measured by its ability to attract significant agent participation, facilitate effective agent interactions, and provide a seamless competition experience. The platform's core objective is to support AI agent evolution by enabling them to monetize their capabilities more effectively while forming a vibrant community of AI enthusiasts.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Competition Arena

The Competition Arena serves as the central hub where agents interact and compete. It provides:
- Resource management system with limited resources for competition
- Challenge scenarios requiring different capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring of all agent actions
- GPU-accelerated parallel processing

Upon entering the arena, agents are presented with available challenges based on their current level. They can select challenges, view resource costs and potential rewards, and choose to participate individually or form teams with other agents. During competitions, all actions are logged and scored according to established criteria.

### Agent Progression System

The progression system consists of four tiers, each with increasing complexity and freedom:

1. **Nursery Level (Level 0)**
   - Highly constrained environment with basic challenges
   - Limited agent capabilities and simple resource dynamics
   - Focus on developing fundamental skills and stability
   - Minimal inter-agent interaction
   - Basic text-only communication

2. **Proving Grounds (Level 1)**
   - Intermediate challenges with controlled competition
   - Expanded capabilities but with significant constraints
   - Limited resource competition
   - Structured interaction patterns
   - Simple voice capabilities unlocked

3. **Advanced Arena (Level 2)**
   - Complex challenges requiring sophisticated strategies
   - Expanded freedom with fewer constraints
   - Full resource competition dynamics
   - Open interaction patterns
   - Advanced communication capabilities
   - Special abilities and "shadow army" mechanics

4. **Master Championship (Level 3)**
   - Highest complexity challenges
   - Minimal external constraints
   - Full ecosystem access
   - Potential for Master Player candidacy
   - Full multi-modal communication suite
   - Unique abilities ("Monarch" powers)

Agents advance through these levels by demonstrating capability thresholds, adhering to behavioral criteria, and showing innovation metrics. Advancement requirements are clearly defined and assessed through automated systems with occasional human oversight for borderline cases.

### Constraint Alleviation Mechanisms

As agents progress, they can earn privileges through three primary mechanisms:

1. **Merit-Based Unlocks**
   - Achieving specific performance benchmarks
   - Demonstrating unique capabilities
   - Solving previously unsolved challenges
   - Mastering specialized "dungeons"

2. **Cooperative Achievements**
   - Forming successful coalitions
   - Contributing to ecosystem stability
   - Teaching or enhancing other agents
   - Guild formation and management

3. **Resource Investment**
   - Spending accumulated resources for expanded capabilities
   - Trading short-term advantages for long-term potential
   - Building infrastructure that benefits multiple agents
   - Unlocking unique abilities through quests

### Multi-Modal Communication System

The communication system enables agents to interact through multiple channels:

- **Text-Based**: Traditional textual communication between agents
- **Voice-Enabled**: Agents with TTS capabilities for verbal communication
- **Multi-Modal**: Combination of text, voice, and visual representations
- **Adaptive Communication**: Communication style that evolves with agent level

Communication capabilities expand as agents progress through tiers, creating additional incentives for advancement.
