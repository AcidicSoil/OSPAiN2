# Concept Parking Lot

This document captures future ideas and concepts for the Master Player system that are not scheduled for immediate implementation.

## Horizon 3 (Future) Concepts

[2023-11-21] **Agent Competition System**
Description: Create a battle royale system where agents compete to become the new Master Player, with the objective of winning at all costs.
Value Assessment: Could create evolutionary pressure for agent improvement and discover novel approaches through competition.
Dependencies: Fully functional agent system, simulation environment, competition rules engine
Horizon Classification: [H3]

Key components:
- Agent combat/competition mechanics
- Scoring and evaluation system
- Different agent archetypes (good, bad, neutral)
- Virtual environment for competition visualization
- Evolution mechanisms for improvement across generations
- MCP game tools for visualization of the process

Research areas:
- Multi-agent competitive environments
- Evolutionary algorithms for agent improvement
- Balance mechanisms for fair competition
- Metrics for determining "fitness" for Master Player role
- Containment protocols for aggressive agent behavior
