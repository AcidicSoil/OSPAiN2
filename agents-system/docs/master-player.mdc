## Prompt Template Patterns

### Task Planning Template

```
I need to plan a task: {task_name}
Description: {task_description}

Please break this down into subtasks with the following considerations:
- Each subtask should be clearly defined with inputs and outputs
- Consider dependencies between subtasks
- Estimate complexity for each subtask
- Include validation steps where appropriate
- Consider potential failure points and mitigation strategies

Format the response as a structured plan with numbered steps.
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Decompose complex tasks into manageable units
- Identify dependencies clearly
- Include validation points
- Consider failure scenarios
- Maintain appropriate abstraction level

### Code Generation Template

```
Generate code for: {task_name}
Requirements: {requirements}
Context: {context}
Language/Framework: {language}

The code should:
- Be well-structured and maintainable
- Include appropriate error handling
- Follow best practices for {language}
- Be optimized for {optimization_criteria}

Additional considerations:
{special_considerations}
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Clear specification of requirements
- Appropriate error handling
- Following language-specific conventions
- Including necessary imports
- Commenting complex logic

### Task Decomposition Template

```
I have a complex task: {task_name}
Description: {detailed_description}

Please perform a hierarchical decomposition with the following:
1. High-level components (3-5 major parts)
2. For each component, 2-4 specific implementation tasks
3. For each implementation task, specific technical requirements
4. Dependencies between components and tasks
5. Suggested implementation order

{additional_constraints}
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Appropriate granularity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Logical grouping of related tasks
- Identifying critical path items
- Consideration of technical constraints

### File Operation Template

```
I need to perform file operations for: {operation_name}
Files involved:
{file_list}

Operations needed:
{detailed_operations}

Considerations:
- Ensure proper error handling for file access issues
- Validate input/output paths
- Consider permissions and security
- Handle encoding appropriately
- Implement appropriate logging
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Handling file not found scenarios
- Checking permissions before operations
- Using appropriate file modes
- Handling encoding issues
- Proper resource cleanup

### Agent Decision Template

```
As an agent with capabilities: {capabilities}
I need to make a decision about: {decision_point}

Context:
{detailed_context}

Options available:
{options_list}

Evaluation criteria:
{criteria}

Please recommend the best option with reasoning.
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Comprehensive evaluation of all options
- Connecting decision to evaluation criteria
- Providing clear reasoning
- Considering edge cases
- Acknowledging trade-offs

### Performance Optimization Template

```
I need to optimize: {target_system}
Current performance: {current_metrics}
Desired performance: {target_metrics}

System details:
{system_description}

Known bottlenecks:
{bottlenecks}

Constraints:
{constraints}

Please provide optimization strategies that consider:
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Resource utilization
- Implementation effort
- Maintenance impact
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Identifying true bottlenecks
- Prioritizing optimizations by impact
- Considering trade-offs
- Suggesting measurable improvements
- Respecting constraints

### Chain of Thought Template

```
Problem: {problem_statement}

Let me think through this step-by-step:

1. First, I'll identify what I know:
   {known_facts}

2. Next, I'll identify what I need to determine:
   {objectives}

3. I'll explore relevant approaches:
   {approaches}

4. For each approach, I'll analyze:
   - Applicability to the problem
   - Advantages and disadvantages
   - Implementation considerations

5. I'll select the most appropriate approach and implement it:
   {implementation_plan}

6. Finally, I'll verify the solution:
   {verification_steps}
```

**Key Success Factors:**
- Explicit reasoning process
- Considering multiple approaches
- Evaluating options systematically
- Showing calculations/derivations
- Verifying solution validity
