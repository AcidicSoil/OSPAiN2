## Modern Training Techniques

1. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**:
   - **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Freeze pre-trained weights and inject trainable rank decomposition matrices (saves 90%+ memory).
   - **QLoRA**: Use 4-bit quantization with LoRA for even greater memory efficiency.
   - **LongLoRA**: Extend context windows through shift short attention for processing longer sequences.

2. **Quantization**: 
   - Reduce model precision from 16-bit to 8-bit or 4-bit to decrease memory usage.
   - Use techniques like NF4 (Normal Float 4-bit) for better training stability.

3. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**:
   - Replace complex RLHF with simpler preference pairs for alignment.
   - More stable and computationally efficient than traditional reinforcement learning.

## Cost-Effective Learning: Practicing with Smaller Models
<!-- @context: Relates to resource-optimization.js for efficient compute usage -->

Before investing in expensive large model training, establish your workflow with smaller models:

### Recommended Small Models for Practice

| Model | Size | VRAM Required | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Phi-2 | 2.7B | 5-6GB | Reasoning, coding | General practice |
| Gemma | 2B | 4-5GB | Instruction following | Fine-tuning basics |
| Stable LM | 3B | 6-7GB | Creative text | Content generation |
| TinyLlama | 1.1B | 3-4GB | Low resource | Mobile/edge devices |
| RWKV | 1.5B | 4GB | Fast inference | Experimentation |

### Scaling Workflow

1. **Start with knowledge distillation experiments**:
   - Use a tiny model (1-3B) to learn the training pipeline
   - Experiment with hyperparameters at lower cost
   - Debug data preparation issues without expensive compute

2. **Technique validation on medium models**:
   - Test LoRA/QLoRA configurations on 7B models
   - Verify prompt templates work as expected
   - Validate evaluation metrics

3. **Hardware stepping stones**:
   ```
   Consumer GPU (RTX 3060, 12GB) ‚Üí High-end GPU (RTX 4090, 24GB) ‚Üí Data center GPU (A100, 80GB)
   ```

4. **Transferable skills**:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques transfer directly
   - Evaluation pipelines remain consistent across model sizes
   - PEFT configurations can be proportionally scaled up

### Budget-Conscious Practice Strategy

1. **Local development with TinyLlama (1.1B)**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Fine-tune TinyLlama with LoRA on consumer GPU
   python train.py \
     --model_name_or_path TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 \
     --lora_r 8 \
     --lora_alpha 16 \
     --batch_size 4 \
     --gradient_accumulation_steps 8
   ```

2. **Scale to Phi-2 (2.7B) for improved capabilities**:
   - Apply lessons from TinyLlama training
   - Increase context length gradually
   - Test with more complex prompts

3. **Graduate to 7B models once workflow is validated**:
   - Mistral 7B or Llama 3 8B using QLoRA
   - Apply the same scripts with adjusted parameters
   - Scale batch size appropriately

### Free and Low-Cost Training Resources

- **Google Colab**: Free tier supports up to 15GB VRAM (T4 GPU)
- **Kaggle**: Free notebooks with P100 GPUs (limited hours)
- **Vast.ai**: Rent consumer GPUs at $0.20-0.35/hour
- **Lambda Labs**: Academic credits available for research
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Free training environments for small models

## Advanced Model Architectures

1. **Multimodal Training**:
   - Combine text, image, and video data in a single model (like LLaVA or Qwen-VL).
   - Use contrastive learning to align different modalities.

2. **Planning and Reasoning Techniques**:
   - Implement tree-of-thought or chain-of-thought prompting.
   - Use self-improvement techniques for iterative refinement of outputs.

## Integration with Sovereign AI Infrastructure
<!-- @context: Directly implements the Model Serving Layer from sovereign_ai_implementation.mdc -->

This training approach integrates seamlessly with our local-first sovereign AI infrastructure:

1. **Local Model Serving**: Trained models plug into our lightweight model server
2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Training data and results are cached in the knowledge graph
3. **Multi-level Caching**: Model weights and embeddings use the established cache layer
4. **Distributed Computing Support**: Training can be distributed across available resources

## Practical Implementation Steps

1. **Base Model Selection**:
   - Start with proven open-source models (Mistral 7B, Llama 3, or DeepSeek Coder).
   - Consider Ollama-compatible models from your config.
   
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Create high-quality, diverse, and task-specific datasets.
   - Clean and filter data to reduce bias and improve performance.
   - Implement contextual and retrieval augmentation.

3. **Optimization Strategy**:
   ```python
   # Example QLoRA implementation with bitsandbytes and PEFT
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
       "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1",
       quantization_config=BitsAndBytesConfig(
           load_in_4bit=True,
           bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
           bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"
       )
   )
   
   peft_config = LoraConfig(
       r=16,                       # Rank dimension
       lora_alpha=32,              # Scale parameter
       target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"], # Layers to fine-tune
       lora_dropout=0.05,          # Dropout probability
       bias="none"
   )
   ```

4. **Training Infrastructure**:
   - Use gradient accumulation for limited hardware (effective batch size = micro_batch √ó accumulation_steps).
   - Implement learning rate scheduling with warmup.
   - Enable checkpointing to save intermediate states.

## Hardware Requirements

For local training, consider:
- **High-end GPU**: A100, H100, or at minimum RTX 4090 (24GB+ VRAM)
- **Cooling**: Adequate thermal management for extended training sessions
- **Storage**: NVMe drives for faster data access
- **Alternative**: Cloud-based GPUs if local resources are limited
