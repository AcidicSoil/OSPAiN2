# Ollama Ecosystem - Horizon Framework Map

## Purpose
This document establishes clear horizons for focused development in the Ollama Ecosystem Project, organizing elements into distinct timeframes for implementation and planning.

## Horizon Definitions

- **Horizon 1 (H1)**: Current focus - Features and concepts actively being implemented
- **Horizon 2 (H2)**: Next phase - Concepts cleared for planning but not yet ready for implementation
- **Horizon 3 (H3)**: Future ideas - Concepts captured but deliberately kept for future consideration

## Current Horizon Classification

### Horizon 1 (Now)

#### Core Infrastructure
- OSPAiN2-hub frontend implementation
- API server for todo management
- Docker setup and integration
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Knip)
- Development Mode Framework

#### UI Components
- UI Component Library Phase 2 (60% complete)
  - Completed Components: Button, Card, Input, ErrorDisplay, Modal, Dropdown, Toast, Tabs
  - In Progress: Breadcrumbs, Pagination components
  - Upcoming (Phase 2): Collapsible panel, Status indicators, Progress bars
- TodoManager component
- EcosystemGraph visualization component
- AgentPanel components
- PydanticFormBuilder for dynamic form generation

#### System Architecture
- Local-first infrastructure
- Knowledge Graph integration
- MCP Server implementation

#### CLI Tools
- Tag CLI engine for todo management
- Mode switcher for development modes
- Context management tools

### Horizon 2 (Next)

- Export functionality for research results

## Horizon Transition Process

### Promotion Criteria
For H2 ‚Üí H1 promotion:
- Prerequisites and dependencies must be fulfilled
- Resource availability confirmed
- Clear implementation plan established
- Success metrics defined

For H3 ‚Üí H2 promotion:
- Strategic alignment with project goals
- Technical feasibility assessed
- Preliminary resource requirements estimated
- User value proposition clearly articulated

### Review Schedule
- Weekly horizon review: Monday
- End-of-cycle promotion evaluation: Every 3 weeks
- Reflection and parking lot processing: Friday

## Integration with Development Modes

Each horizon aligns with specific development modes:

**H1 Implementation**:
- üîß Engineering Mode: Core functionality implementation
- üß™ Testing Mode: Quality assurance for active features
- üì¶ Deployment Mode: Release preparation for completed features

**H2 Planning**:
- üé® Design Mode: Architecture and UI planning
- üîß Engineering Mode: Technical spike development

**H3 Ideation**:
- üé® Design Mode: Concept exploration
- üîç Maintenance Mode: Future improvement identification

## Horizon Management Process

1. **Capture** ideas in appropriate horizon
2. **Evaluate** ideas against promotion criteria
3. **Promote** items between horizons during scheduled reviews
4. **Focus** development efforts on H1 items only
5. **Reflect** on horizon effectiveness regularly

## Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ Horizon definitions established
- ‚úÖ Initial classification of project elements completed
- üîÑ Integration with master-todo.mdc in progress
- üîÑ Transition process implementation in progress
- üîÑ Review schedule implementation in progress
