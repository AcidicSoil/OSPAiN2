# Prioritized Technical Synergy Implementation Plan

## 🔧 Priority 1: Mode Orchestration Framework

**Purpose:** Create structured development workflow across operational modes

### Current Progress:
- [X] Basic mode command structure
- [X] Mode transition commands (alias support)
- [ ] Context preservation mechanism
- [ ] Mode-specific resource optimization
- [ ] Cross-mode event notification system

### Next Steps:
1. Complete context preservation implementation
2. Build mode-specific configuration profiles
3. Implement transition events for component notifications
4. Create mode visualization indicators in UI

**Checkpoint Criteria:** ✅ Move to next priority when context preservation and basic transition protocol are functioning

---

## 🧠 Priority 2: Knowledge Management System

**Purpose:** Enable contextual awareness and semantic understanding across the ecosystem

### Current Progress:
- [X] Basic conversation tracking
- [X] Initial file context association
- [ ] Tag system implementation
- [ ] Semantic search capabilities
- [ ] Cross-component context awareness

### Next Steps:
1. Implement local embedding generation
2. Create hierarchical tag organization system
3. Develop semantic similarity search
4. Build automatic context summarization

**Checkpoint Criteria:** ✅ Move to next priority when semantic search is operational and tag system is hierarchical

---

## 🏗️ Priority 3: Local AI Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Establish sovereign control over AI models and computation

### Current Progress:
- [ ] Local model loading/serving
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Multi-level caching strategy
- [ ] Model switching capabilities

### Next Steps:
1. Implement basic model server
2. Create cache layer (memory and disk)
3. Build resource monitoring system
4. Develop model lifecycle management

**Checkpoint Criteria:** ✅ Move to next priority when local models can be loaded and basic caching is functional

---

## 🔌 Priority 4: MCP Tool Selection Optimization

**Purpose:** Intelligently select and manage MCP tools based on current mode and context

### Current Progress:
- [X] Basic MCP tool integration
- [ ] Tool usage analytics
- [ ] Mode-specific tool prioritization
- [ ] Tool call batching
- [ ] Fallback strategies for tool limits

### Next Steps:
1. Implement tool usage tracking
2. Create mode-specific tool configurations
3. Develop intelligent tool selection algorithms
4. Build tool call batching for similar operations

**Checkpoint Criteria:** ✅ Move to next priority when mode-specific tool prioritization is working

---

## 📝 Priority 5: TypeScript Incremental Refactoring

**Purpose:** Improve code quality, maintainability, and error prevention

### Current Progress:
- [X] Basic TypeScript implementation
- [X] Some component typing
- [ ] Critical component strict typing
- [ ] Interface definitions for core systems
- [ ] Error handling standardization

### Next Steps:
1. Define core interfaces and types
2. Implement strict typing for MCP components
3. Add strict typing to Mode Orchestration
4. Extend typing to Knowledge Management

**Checkpoint Criteria:** ✅ Project reaches completion milestone when all critical systems have strict typing
