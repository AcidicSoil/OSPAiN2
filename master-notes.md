## Frontend Migration Strategy Decision

**Date: March 15, 2025**

After careful evaluation of the project status and resource constraints, we've decided to **opt out of the full framework migration to T3 Stack** in favor of a targeted component-by-component migration approach. Key factors in this decision:

1. The Vite implementation is already well underway with core infrastructure complete
2. Component migration offers faster delivery (10-15 days vs. 25-30 days for full migration)
3. This approach better aligns with other priorities like the GitLens visualization implementation
4. The component-based approach reduces technical risk and allows for incremental value delivery

See the `migration-decision.md` document for complete details on the implementation plan and rationale.

## Indexing Optimization Approach

Our approach to optimizing indexing is based on enhancing existing systems rather than creating new structures:

1. **Hybrid Search Integration**: Enhance the current search system with hybrid capabilities (vector + keyword)
2. **Semantic Chunking**: Improve how we divide content for better retrieval while preserving context
3. **Context-Aware Caching**: Implement multi-level caching within existing systems
4. **Development Mode Integration**: Optimize search based on current dev mode (design, engineering, etc.)
5. **Structure Improvement**: Better organize existing files without radical restructuring

This optimization strategy:
- Builds upon established foundations
- Integrates with t2p for task/note context
- Leverages existing mode systems for context-aware searches
- Enhances knowledge retrieval without creating parallel structures
- Improves development workflow with faster, more relevant results
