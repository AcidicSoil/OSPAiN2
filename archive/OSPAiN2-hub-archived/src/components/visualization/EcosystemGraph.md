# EcosystemGraph Component Migration Plan

## Component Overview

The EcosystemGraph component provides a force-directed graph visualization of the Ollama ecosystem, featuring:
- Interactive node exploration
- Zoom and pan controls
- Node filtering capabilities
- Visual representation of relationships
- Custom tooltips for node information

## Source Component

- Source: `ollama-schematics-ui/src/components/visualization/EcosystemGraph.tsx`
- Dependencies:
  - react-force-graph (main visualization library)
  - d3 (for color scales and force simulations)
  - React state management
  - Custom styling

## Migration Steps

1. **Dependencies**
   - [ ] Add react-force-graph dependency to OSPAiN2-hub package.json
   - [ ] Add d3 dependency if not already present
   - [ ] Verify compatibility with current React version

2. **Component Migration**
   - [ ] Copy base component structure
   - [ ] Update import paths
   - [ ] Adapt to OSPAiN2-hub component patterns
   - [ ] Convert custom styles to Tailwind CSS where applicable

3. **Data Integration**
   - [ ] Implement data fetching with Zustand or React Query
   - [ ] Create data transformation utilities
   - [ ] Set up refresh mechanisms

4. **UI Adaptation**
   - [ ] Ensure responsive behavior
   - [ ] Implement controls that match OSPAiN2-hub design system
   - [ ] Add loading states and error handling

5. **Integration**
   - [ ] Add to visualization page or dashboard
   - [ ] Update navigation to include visualization
   - [ ] Test performance with various data sets

## Implementation Timeline

- Estimated time: 2-3 days
- Target completion: End of week

## Migration Status

- [ ] Dependencies added
- [ ] Basic component structure migrated
- [ ] Data integration implemented
- [ ] UI adapted to design system
- [ ] Performance optimization completed
