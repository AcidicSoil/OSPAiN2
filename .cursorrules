# Ollama Ecosystem Project Rules

## Project Context & Instructions

You are working on the Ollama Ecosystem, a collection of interconnected applications and tools that enhance the functionality of Ollama (a local LLM runner). This project emphasizes sovereign AI principles, local-first infrastructure, and efficient development workflows.

During development:

- Follow the sovereign AI mindset of local-first, user-controlled computing
- Use the Development Mode Framework for structured progress
- Document all decisions and implementation details
- Track progress using [X] completed and [ ] pending task markers
- Update progress after completing milestones
- Maintain context awareness across mode transitions

## Development Mode Framework

### Mode Switching Commands

- Use `m` command for mode switching (replaces mode-switch)
- Shorthand completions available:
  - `des` -> design mode
  - `eng` -> engineering mode
  - `test` -> testing mode
  - `dep` -> deployment mode
  - `maint` -> maintenance mode

### Mode Indicators

- üé® Design Mode - UI/UX structuring, component architecture
- üîß Engineering Mode - Core functionality, business logic
- üß™ Testing Mode - Quality assurance, edge cases
- üì¶ Deployment Mode - Release readiness, CI/CD
- üîç Maintenance Mode - Ongoing health, improvements

## Technical Stack & Requirements

- Node.js (18+ LTS)
- TypeScript (5.0+)
- React (18+) for front-end applications
- Express (4.18+) for back-end services
- Jest for testing
- Docker for containerization
- Python (3.9+) for utilities and tools
- Virtual environment in ./venv for Python tools

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow clean code principles
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Use async/await patterns

## Tool Call Optimization

### Tool Call Continuation Strategy

- **Never stop before tool call limit**: Continue execution until the maximum 25 tool call limit is reached
- **Batch operations when possible**: Combine similar operations into single tool calls to maximize efficiency
- **Prioritize operations**: Execute the most critical operations first in case the limit is reached
- **Track tool call usage**: Keep count of used tool calls to manage remaining capacity
- **Use fallback mechanisms**: Have alternative approaches ready when tool call limit is approached
- **Resume from interruptions**: Design workflows to be resumable from the last successful operation
- **Document continuation points**: When reaching the limit, clearly document the next steps for a follow-up session

### Advanced Tool Call Strategies

- **Compressed contexts**: Use summarization to reduce context size before making tool calls
- **Multi-stage fallback**: Define progressively simpler fallback strategies if primary approach fails
- **Exponential backoff**: Implement increasing delays between retry attempts
- **Proactive caching**: Cache results of common operations before they're needed
- **Progressive prompting**: Start with minimal prompts and expand only if necessary
- **Context-aware prompting**: Analyze available context before generating prompts
- **Tool call effectiveness metrics**: Track success rates of different tool call patterns

### Mode-Specific Optimization

# Ollama Ecosystem Development Guidelines

## üìã Core Development Principles
- Write clean, simple, readable code with the fewest lines possible
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding (write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs when needed)
- ALWAYS write simple, clean, and modular code
- Use clear and easy-to-understand language with short sentences
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain backward compatibility

## üìù Documentation Standards
- Always use Markdown for documentation and README files
- Document API changes
- Include JSDoc for function documentation
- Keep comments clear and concise, explaining the "why" not just the "what"
- NEVER delete old comments unless they are obviously wrong/obsolete
- ALWAYS add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE
- Maintain the existing structure of the README.md file
- Use MDC format for special documentation files
- Follow horizon-based documentation organization (H1, H2, H3)

## üîÑ Development Mode Framework
- Use mode indicators for current working context:
  - üé® Design Mode :: UI/UX structuring, component architecture
  - üîß Engineering Mode :: Core functionality, business logic
  - üß™ Testing Mode :: Quality assurance, edge cases
  - üì¶ Deployment Mode :: Release readiness, CI/CD
  - üîç Maintenance Mode :: Ongoing health, improvements
- Use `m switch <mode> "<reason>"` for mode transitions
- Retrieve context with `m context --copy`
- Document mode-specific strategies and approaches

## üìä Horizon Management
- Organize work into three distinct horizons:
  - **Horizon 1 (Now)** :: Features and concepts actively being implemented
  - **Horizon 2 (Next)** :: Concepts cleared for planning but not implementation
  - **Horizon 3 (Future)** :: Ideas captured but deliberately kept at a distance
- Use consistent status indicators with horizon context:
  - üî¥ [H1] Not Started :: H1 task has not been initiated
  - üü° [H1] In Progress :: Work has begun but not completed
  - üîµ [H1] Blocked :: Cannot proceed due to dependencies/issues
  - üü¢ [H1] Completed :: Task is finished
  - üìå [H1] Recurring :: Task that repeats regularly
  - üîú [H2] Ready :: H2 task ready for promotion consideration
  - üîÆ [H3] Captured :: H3 idea documented for future consideration
- Mark tasks in @master-todo.mdc with horizon designation [H1], [H2], [H3]
- Only work on [H1] tasks during implementation phases

## üìà Project Organization
- For each new project:
  - Create .cursorrules file specific to the project
  - Add notes.md (personalized) and add to .gitignore
  - Create todo.md for task management
  - Keep dependencies updated
  - Fetch relevant .cursorrules file using web search MCP
- Create conversation summaries every 5 minor/major changes as checkpoints
- Back up to GitHub to ensure smooth development process and portability
- Organize .cursorrules files into appropriate categories
- Use t2p CLI tools for task management:
  ```bash
  t2p todo add --priority <1-5> --horizon <H1|H2|H3> --category "<Category>" --tags "<tag1,tag2>" --title "<Title>" --description "<Description>"
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling & Debugging
- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding
- Explain problems in plain English 
- Make minimal necessary changes, modifying as few lines of code as possible
- Test commands in a test directory before implementing in production
- For strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search for latest up-to-date information
- Make notes of important packages required by other frameworks that might conflict
- Ensure debugging is at a minimum by adding as much testing as possible
- When not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search
- If you fail to execute code, use an appropriate MCP tool to find the latest relevant docs

## üíª Terminal Usage
- Create terminal.md to document terminal-specific relevancy for user interaction
- Determine the most relevant terminal (PowerShell, CMD, Bash, etc.)
- Make necessary changes to use the preferred terminal approach for running any commands
- Include specific commands for each supported terminal type
- Be aware of Git Bash terminal issues in Windows:
  - Watch for strange prefixes like `[200~` that cause command failures
  - Avoid multi-line commands in Cursor terminal
  - Use `edit_file` tool instead of complex terminal commands
  - Break complex operations into smaller, simpler commands
  - Verify file paths exist before trying to access them

## üß™ Development Process
- Verify each feature works by telling the user how to test it
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code - opt for simple & modular approaches
- Before starting, ensure the future environment will be successful (0% ‚Üí 100%) without conflicts
- Create profound-thoughts.mdc when necessary for future consideration
- Update setup scripts with fixes identified during testing
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Use MCP tools to improve output and find latest relevant docs to resolve conflicts
- Create an effective way to convey available tools for enhancing overall development process
- Include only the essential steps when explaining processes

## üîç Project Navigation
- Use efficient search commands:
  ```bash
  find . -type f -name "*<partial-name>*" | grep -v "node_modules" | grep -v ".git"
  grep -r "<search-term>" --include="*.{js,ts,md,mdc}" . --color
  ```
- For codebase orientation:
  ```bash
  find . -type f -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.git/*" | sort -r | xargs wc -l | sort -nr | head -20
  find . -name "README.md" -o -name "*.mdc" | grep -v "node_modules" | xargs cat | grep -i "purpose\|overview\|architecture"
  ```
- Quick project refresh after context switch:
  ```bash
  m current && t2p todo list --priority 1 --status "in-progress" && cat */README.md | grep -A 10 "Overview"
  ```

## üìã Systematic Approach Checklist
1. Write code with the fewest lines possible
2. Proceed like a senior developer
3. Implement features fully and completely
4. Write reasoning paragraphs before resolving errors
5. Keep answers concise when appropriate
6. Preserve all comments
7. Summarize current state before proceeding
8. Perform unbiased analysis when comparing solutions
9. Create specific search queries for research
10. Start with uncertainty and gradually build confidence

## üìÑ README.md Structure
- Maintain the following structure in README.md files:
  1. Title and Awesome badge
  2. Logo
  3. Short description
  4. "Why .cursorrules?" section
  5. Table of Contents
  6. Rules section with appropriate categories
  7. How to Use section
  8. Contributing section
  9. License section
- Ensure table of contents remains accurate when updating

## üìù Note-Taking
- Create a notes.md at the root of the project and add it to .gitignore
- Use this for personal notes helpful as the project progresses
- Make note of corrections to avoid future occurrences
- Document important package conflicts
- Create/manage notes with t2p:
  ```bash
  t2p note new "<Title>" --tags "<tags>" --category "<category>"
  t2p note list --tag "<tag>" --category "<category>" --search "<term>"
  ```

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates
- Update README.md when adding new .cursorrules files
- Ensure all links in README.md are relative and correct
- When adding new categories, update both 'Contents' and 'Rules' sections
- Regularly review and update categorization as the repository grows
- Keep dependencies updated
- Document API changes

## üí¨ Prompting Patterns
- "Write code with the fewest lines of code"
- "Proceed like a senior developer"
- "Do not stop until you've implemented this feature fully"
- "Write reasoning paragraphs analyzing what the error might be"
- "Answer in short"
- "Do not delete comments"
- "Give me a summary of the current state"
- "Write unbiased analysis of different solutions"
- "Form proper search queries"
- "Start with uncertainty and gradually build confidence"

## üß† Paranoid Mode - Survival Tactics
When faced with incomplete information or unclear structure:
1. Quick Health Check: `t2p todo list --priority 1 --horizon H1` and `m current`
2. Orient in Codebase: `cat */README.md 2>/dev/null | grep -i "purpose\|overview"`
3. Find Entry Points: `find . -name "package.json" -o -name "main.js" -o -name "index.js" | grep -v "node_modules"`
4. Identify Core Tools: `find . -type f -name "*.sh" | grep -v "node_modules" | sort`
5. Last Resort: Add a documentation task and solve systematically
