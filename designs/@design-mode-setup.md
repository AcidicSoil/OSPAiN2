# Design Mode Setup - ðŸŽ¨ 

This document outlines the design framework and resources that have been set up for the Ollama Ecosystem Project's Design Mode.

## Completed Setup

The following design framework has been established:

### 1. Design Directory Structure

```
designs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Main design documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                       # Design tokens and foundational elements
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tokens.md             # Color, typography, spacing definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ components/               # Component specifications
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Component design guidelines 
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/                  # Page layouts and grid systems
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Layout design guidelines
â”œâ”€â”€ prototypes/               # Mockups and interactive prototypes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Prototype guidelines
â””â”€â”€ wireframes/               # Low-fidelity wireframes
    â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/            # Dashboard wireframes
    â”œâ”€â”€ chat-interface/       # Chat interface wireframes
    â”œâ”€â”€ research-panel/       # Research panel wireframes
    â””â”€â”€ settings/             # Settings wireframes
```

### 2. Design System Foundation

- **Design Tokens**: Established color palette, typography, spacing, and other foundational UI elements
- **Component Structure**: Set up atomic design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- **Layout Framework**: Created responsive grid system and standard layout templates
- **Prototype Guidelines**: Defined prototype creation process and documentation standards

### 3. Development Mode Integration

- Successfully activated Design Mode using the mode switcher
- Associated design artifacts with the proper development context
- Established guidelines for design-to-engineering handoff

## Next Steps

The following tasks should be prioritized next:

### 1. Component Design

- [ ] Create designs for atomic components (buttons, inputs, form controls)
- [ ] Design molecular components (search bars, navigation items)
- [ ] Develop organism-level components (navigation bars, panels)
- [ ] Create template designs for key application sections

### 2. Wireframe Development

- [ ] Create dashboard wireframes
- [ ] Design chat interface wireframes
- [ ] Develop research panel wireframes
- [ ] Create settings interface wireframes

### 3. Visual Design

- [ ] Develop high-fidelity mockups based on wireframes
- [ ] Create visual style guide with examples
- [ ] Design key user flows as interactive prototypes
- [ ] Create component states (hover, active, disabled, etc.)

### 4. Responsive Design

- [ ] Ensure all designs adapt to mobile screens
- [ ] Create tablet-specific layout adjustments
- [ ] Design responsive behavior for key components
- [ ] Document breakpoint-specific changes

### 5. Accessibility 

- [ ] Audit designs for color contrast compliance
- [ ] Ensure interactive elements have appropriate states
- [ ] Document focus states and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Create accessible form guidelines

## How to Contribute

To contribute to the design system:

1. Switch to Design Mode using the mode switcher:
   ```
   cd development-modes && ./mode_switcher.sh switch design "Working on [specific design task]"
   ```

2. Follow the directory structure to add new design artifacts

3. Document all design decisions and rationale

4. Request feedback from team members

5. Update the master todo list with completed design tasks

## Design Principles

Remember to follow these key design principles:

1. **Local-First Infrastructure**: Design interfaces that prioritize local computation while providing seamless transitions to remote resources when necessary
2. **Intuitive Knowledge Access**: Create interfaces that make complex knowledge structures accessible and navigable
3. **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Reduce unnecessary complexity and cognitive overhead in all interfaces
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal functionality incrementally as users need it
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Maintain visual and interaction consistency across all components
6. **Accessibility First**: Design for users with diverse abilities from the beginning
