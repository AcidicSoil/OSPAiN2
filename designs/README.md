# Design Documentation - UI/UX Framework ðŸŽ¨

This directory contains design artifacts, documentation, and resources for the Ollama Ecosystem Project UI/UX framework.

## Directory Structure

- **ui/**: Design tokens, color palettes, typography guidelines, and other foundational UI elements
- **components/**: Component specifications, wireframes, and documentation
- **layouts/**: Page layouts, grid systems, and responsive design patterns
- **prototypes/**: Interactive prototypes and mockups

## Design Principles

1. **Local-First Infrastructure**: Design interfaces that prioritize local computation while providing seamless transitions to remote resources when necessary
2. **Intuitive Knowledge Access**: Create interfaces that make complex knowledge structures accessible and navigable
3. **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Reduce unnecessary complexity and cognitive overhead in all interfaces
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal functionality incrementally as users need it
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Maintain visual and interaction consistency across all components
6. **Accessibility First**: Design for users with diverse abilities from the beginning

## Design System

Our design system consists of:

- **Visual Language**: Colors, typography, spacing, and imagery
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements like buttons, forms, and cards
- **Patterns**: Standard interaction patterns for common tasks
- **Voice & Tone**: How we communicate with users through text

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding to the design documentation:

1. Follow established naming conventions
2. Use Markdown for textual documentation
3. Export designs in both editable source formats and viewable formats (PNG/SVG)
4. Include rationale for design decisions
5. Reference related components and patterns
6. Update this README when adding new sections

## Tools & Resources

- **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD
- **Icon Libraries**: Phosphor Icons, Custom Ollama icons
- **Color Tools**: Coolors, Adobe Color
- **Accessibility**: WCAG Guidelines, Contrast Checkers
- **Typography**: Google Fonts, Typography.js

## Usage

This design documentation serves as the foundation for implementing the UI components in the codebase. Developers should refer to these specifications when creating or modifying UI elements to ensure consistency across the ecosystem.
