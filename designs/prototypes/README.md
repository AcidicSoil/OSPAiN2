# UI Prototypes & Mockups

This directory contains interactive prototypes, mockups, and visual design artifacts for the Ollama Ecosystem user interfaces.

## Prototype Types

Prototypes in this directory are organized by fidelity level and purpose:

1. **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity skeletal frameworks of interfaces
2. **Mockups**: Medium to high-fidelity static representations 
3. **Interactive Prototypes**: Clickable prototypes demonstrating user flows
4. **Design Specs**: Detailed specifications with measurements and properties

## File Naming Convention

Use consistent naming for all prototype files:

`[section]-[component]-[state/variant]-[version].[extension]`

Examples:
- `dashboard-overview-default-v1.fig`
- `chat-message-user-v2.png`
- `research-results-expanded-v3.svg`
- `settings-api-keys-error-v1.png`

## Prototype Tools

The following tools are used for creating prototypes:

- **Wireframes**: Figma, Adobe XD, or simple sketching tools
- **Mockups**: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch
- **Interactive Prototypes**: Figma, Adobe XD, Framer
- **Design Specs**: Figma, Zeplin, Abstract

## Required Documentation

Each prototype should include accompanying documentation with:

1. **Purpose**: What the prototype is demonstrating
2. **User Story**: The user story or scenario being addressed
3. **Interactions**: Description of interactive elements (for interactive prototypes)
4. **Assumptions**: Design assumptions made
5. **Feedback**: Record of feedback received
6. **Revision History**: Tracking of major changes

Example documentation template:

# Dashboard Overview Prototype

## Purpose
This prototype demonstrates the main dashboard interface for the Ollama Ecosystem, focusing on the model management and recent activity sections.

## User Story
As a user, I want to quickly see my available models and recent activity so I can resume my work efficiently.

## Interactions
- Click on model cards to see details
- Toggle between "Recent" and "Pinned" in the activity section
- Hover over activity items to see action buttons
- Click "New Chat" to start a new conversation

## Assumptions
- User has at least one model installed
- Activity history is available
- User is authenticated

## Feedback
- [2023-03-10] Initial review: Need more emphasis on model details
- [2023-03-15] Second review: Activity section needs better organization

## Revision History
- v1 (2023-03-05): Initial wireframe
- v2 (2023-03-12): Updated based on feedback, added more detail to model cards
- v3 (2023-03-17): Refined activity section, improved visual hierarchy
```

## Review Process

Prototypes should follow this review process:

1. **Internal Design Review**: Review by the design team
2. **Stakeholder Review**: Review by key stakeholders
3. **User Testing**: Testing with actual or representative users
4. **Technical Feasibility Review**: Review by development team
5. **Iteration**: Refinement based on feedback
6. **Documentation**: Document findings and changes
7. **Approval**: Final approval before handoff to development

## Prototype Statuses

Prototypes should be labeled with one of the following statuses:

- **Draft**: Initial work, not ready for review
- **In Review**: Currently being reviewed by stakeholders
- **Testing**: Being tested with users
- **Approved**: Approved for implementation
- **Implemented**: Has been implemented in code
- **Archived**: No longer current, but kept for reference

## Prototype Categories

### 1. Dashboard

- Input area with tools
- Context panel
- Model selection
- Chat history sidebar
- Code blocks and syntax highlighting
- File attachment and display

### 3. Research Panel

The research panel provides deep research capabilities using Tavily API and LLMs.

Key areas for prototyping:
- Research input and configuration
- Results display

## Contributing

When adding new prototypes:

1. Create files following the naming convention
2. Place them in the appropriate directory
3. Include necessary documentation
4. Update this README if adding a new category
5. Request design review before finalization
