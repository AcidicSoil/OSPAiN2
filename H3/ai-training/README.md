# AI Model Training - Horizon 3 Implementation

This directory contains future implementation plans for AI model training within the Ollama ecosystem. These techniques and workflows are scheduled for Horizon 3 (Future) development cycle.

## Contents

- `training-workflow.md`: End-to-end workflow for model training
- `data-preparation.py`: Scripts for preparing and processing training data
- `train.py`: Main training script with LoRA/QLoRA implementation
- `evaluate.py`: Evaluation metrics and testing framework
- `inference.py`: Inference and deployment utilities

## Integration Points

These components will integrate with:
- Knowledge Graph for semantic data caching
- Model Serving Layer for deployment
- Context Management System for knowledge preservation
- Distributed Computing Support for resource optimization

## Relationship to Existing Components

The training workflow builds upon:
- `sovereign_ai_implementation.mdc` infrastructure
- Context distribution framework
- Development Mode Framework
- Resource optimization techniques

## Implementation Priority

These components are currently in Horizon 3, pending promotion to Horizon 2 once:
1. Core infrastructure components are completed
2. Resource management system is fully implemented
3. Knowledge Graph integration is stable
4. Hardware requirements assessment is completed

## Usage

For current AI model usage, please refer to the Ollama configuration in `mcp-setup-guide.md` until these custom training flows are implemented.
