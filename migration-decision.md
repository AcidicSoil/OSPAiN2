# Migration Strategy Decision: Component-Based Approach

## Decision Summary

After evaluating the current state of the project and considering resource constraints, we have decided to **opt out of the full framework migration to T3 Stack** and instead pursue a targeted component-by-component migration approach.

## Rationale

1. **Current Progress**: The Vite implementation is already well underway with:
   - Project setup completed
   - Core infrastructure with Zustand implemented
   - Several UI components already completed

2. **Resource Efficiency**: The component-based approach:
   - Requires 10-15 days (vs. 25-30 days for full framework migration)
   - Enables parallel development with other high-priority tasks
   - Allows for incremental value delivery

3. **Risk Reduction**: Component migration:
   - Has lower technical risk than a full framework change
   - Allows for easier testing and rollback if needed
   - Maintains compatibility with existing code

4. **Alignment with Priorities**: This approach better aligns with:
   - The GitLens visualization implementation (P2 [H1])
   - Horizon framework prioritization of current tasks
   - The component migration plan in migration-plan.mdc

## Implementation Plan

1. **Follow migration-plan.mdc for component migration**:
   - Focus on high-priority components first (TodoManager, EcosystemGraph, KnowledgeExplorer)
   - Continue with medium-priority components
   - Evaluate low-priority components based on value

2. **Continue with current Vite implementation**:
   - Leverage completed infrastructure work
   - Integrate migrated components into current structure
   - Focus on component quality and integration

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Modify master-todo.mdc to reflect this approach
   - Update priority from P1 to P3
   - Adjust timeline and task estimates

## Expected Benefits

- Faster delivery of high-value components
- Reduced migration complexity and risk
- Better resource allocation across competing priorities
- Continued progress on GitLens visualization and other H1 tasks
- Storage savings by consolidating functionality
