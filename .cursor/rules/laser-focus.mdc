Enter relevant mode for the issue at hand (example:: engineering mode :: implementing full functionality between backend & frontend)
See [sovereign-ai-ecosystem-mindmap.svg](mdc:templates/sovereign-ai-ecosystem-mindmap.svg) & [sovereign_ai_implementation.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/sovereign_ai_implementation.mdc) for our philosophy and guidelines
utilize MCP tools to monitor console logs


Make a note in our master-todo first then attempt to resolve users request, if no request explictily by user,
see [master-todo.mdc](mdc:master-todo.mdc) read understand all the moving parts, proceed until all task are completed 100%. If a task shows signs of manual overrides or it could slow us down, move to next task. When a task is finished completely, make a note in our master-todo.md updating the master-todo as you go with details of our progress.
Task Implementation Attempt Threshold: 5
If attempt threshold is exceeded, attempt a work-around solution and make a note in our master-todo steps to implement the correct way.
