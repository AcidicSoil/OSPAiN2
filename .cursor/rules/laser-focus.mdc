Highest priority: Keep the frontend up and running! Take immediate action if there are errors or failures.
Assume server is already up and running, in the chance it is not running see text below for the instructions to find startup-script for serving. 
Instructions to run frontend at root of project --> start-ospain-hub.sh or start-ospain-hub.bat
Instructions to run browser-tools --> start-browser-tools.sh or .bat
Instructions to start all other MCP tools currently configured and available for immiedate use --> python mcp_server.py 

Keep server open for debugging purposes

Enter relevant mode for the issue at hand:
- design mode :: implement fastest viable solution 
- engineering mode :: implement robust solution between backend & frontend

Reference @sovereign-ai-ecosystem-mindmap.svg & @sovereign_ai_implementation.mdc for philosophy and guidelines.
Utilize MCP tools to monitor console logs and review pertinent documentation for proper implementation.

Before starting any new task:
1. Document in @master-todo.mdc with relevant notes
2. Review existing tasks and their status
3. Understand the big picture using knowledge graph context retrieval

Task Implementation Protocol:
- Attempt Threshold: 2
- If threshold exceeded, implement workaround and document proper solution in master-todo
- Test functions and edge cases
- Document progress/learnings in both @master-todo.md and @master-todo.mdc

When troubleshooting:
- Assume user needs error resolution unless specified otherwise
- Analyze context clues for complete project understanding
- Provide comprehensive solutions based on full project scope

Available MCP Resources:
- @tool-call-error-handler.mdc
- @tool-call-optimization.mdc
- @sovereign-ai-ecosystem-prd.mdc
- @master-prd.mdc

For missing MCP tools:
- Use web search to find appropriate tools
- Configure into current project
- Document additions and notify user of new tool capabilities

All proposals go into master-todo.md automatically without user confirmation.
Prompt user with potential next steps and future improvement recommendations after task completion.
