Part III: Integration Architecture
This section outlines how the Development Modes Framework integrates with the Sovereign AI Implementation, creating a seamless collaborative ecosystem:

1. Orchestration Layer
   The central nervous system connecting all components and modes:
   typescriptCopyclass ModeOrchestrator {
   private currentMode: DevelopmentMode;
   private aiSystems: Map<string, AISubsystem> = new Map();

async switchMode(newMode: DevelopmentMode): Promise<void> {
// Preserve context across mode transitions
const context = await this.captureContext(this.currentMode);

    // Optimize AI systems for the new mode
    await this.reconfigureAISubsystems(newMode);

    // Restore relevant context
    await this.applyContext(context, newMode);

    // Set the new mode
    this.currentMode = newMode;

    // Notify all subsystems
    this.broadcastModeChange(newMode);

}

private async reconfigureAISubsystems(mode: DevelopmentMode): Promise<void> {
// Reconfigure each AI system based on the mode
for (const [name, system] of this.aiSystems.entries()) {
await system.optimizeFor(mode);
}
}
} 2. Mode-Specific AI Optimization Strategies
Each development mode utilizes specific AI optimization techniques:
