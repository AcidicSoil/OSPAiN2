Request a new chat window after failing to complete a task immediately after this occurs, stop before proceeding to next task. This will prevent out-of-focus work. 

When updating master-todo.md ensure master-todo.mdc is updated to sync with it 

clean unused files by analyzing your files you read earlier and get an understanding of which files are actually relevant to this project and make a personal note somewhere. Remove all files and deem them as "bloat" and the user will delete them as needed after reviewing. 

create an elegant way of proposing file/folders for deletion if needed. 

When unsure about your next step, review the master todo and create a local note.md relative to the directory you're working in (stay organized) and you'll use this to use as a scratchpad for your personal progress in that goal/task completion status w/ details.
