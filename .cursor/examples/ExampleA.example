# Example A: Basic Rule Tagging System

This file demonstrates how to use the '@' tag system to connect related rules within your codebase.

## Main Context

@master-todo(Main task tracking system for the project. Contains all current priorities, horizon designations, and progress metrics)

@sovereign-ai-ecosystem-prd(Core architecture document defining the ecosystem structure and components)

## Related Context

@master-prd(Development modes framework with detailed implementation guidelines)

@tool-call-optimization(Ensures efficient use of available tool calls, prioritizing critical operations)

## Implementation Details

When implementing a new feature, always consider:

1. The current development mode:
   @master-player(Contains quick commands for mode switching)
   
2. Appropriate error handling:
   @tool-call-error-handler(Provides guidance on handling approaching tool call limits)
   
3. Documentation requirements:
   @devdocs-source(Guidelines for documenting using DevDocs.io as reference)

## Additional Resources

For knowledge management:
@knowledge-graph-search-cache(Efficiently cache web search results in the knowledge graph)

For search optimization:
@web-search-optimization(Format search queries for optimal results)

## Usage Pattern

The '@' tag syntax is:
`@rule-name(context explanation)`

Always provide descriptive context to explain why the referenced rule is relevant in this specific situation.
