   - What are the potential bottlenecks?

## Systems Thinking Analysis

1. Boundaries:

   - What's in scope?
   - What's out of scope?
   - What are the interfaces?

2. Feedback Loops:

   - What reinforcing loops exist?
   - What balancing loops exist?
   - How do they interact?

3. Time Dynamics:
   - What are the short-term effects?
   - What are the long-term implications?
   - What delays might occur?

## Solution Space Exploration

1. Direct Approaches:
