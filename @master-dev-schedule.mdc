# Ollama Ecosystem Project - Master Development Schedule

## Schedule Overview

This document outlines the development schedule for the Ollama Ecosystem Project, organizing work into distinct phases with clear horizons, priorities, and timelines.

## Development Modes Key
- 🎨 **Design Mode**: UI/UX structuring, component architecture design
