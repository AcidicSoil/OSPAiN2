# Text Cleanup Tool Implementation Status

Date: 2025-03-15

## Project Status Summary

### Text Cleanup Tool (H1, P2) - Completed ✅
- Created Node.js script for context-aware text replacement
- Implemented smart pattern detection based on surrounding code context
- Added comprehensive documentation with examples
- Successfully tested on tag system documentation
- Integrated into project workflow (README.md and todo list)

### Milestones Completed
- ✅ Initial implementation of text-cleanup.js
- ✅ Basic text pattern replacement functionality
- ✅ Context-aware smart replacement
- ✅ Dry-run preview mode
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Successfully replaced "ollama-tag-cli" references
- ✅ Enhanced with additional context patterns for various file types
- ✅ Created unit tests for verification
- ✅ Added CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

### Engineering Mode Enhancements
As part of Engineering Mode, we've made the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced Context Detection**:
   - Added code context patterns (require, module.exports, async/await, etc.)
   - Added documentation context patterns (markdown headings, HTML tags, etc.)
   - Added shell script context detection
   - Added package.json context detection
   - Added file path context detection
   - Added capitalization context patterns

2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Created unit tests for all major functionality
   - Implemented test file generation for validation
   - Added test environment setup/teardown procedures
   - Created test cases for different file types and contexts

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
   - Configured test running on multiple Node.js versions
   - Added coverage reporting
   - Implemented automated report generation
   - Added warning system for excessive naming inconsistencies

## Next Steps

While the core functionality is complete, here are some potential future enhancements:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for very large codebases
2. **Advanced Configuration**: Support for custom context detection rules
3. **Statistics Dashboard**: Visual representation of naming consistency across the codebase
4. **IDE Integration**: Consider Visual Studio Code extension for inline use

## Conclusion

The text-cleanup.js tool has been successfully implemented with all planned features. It provides a powerful way to maintain naming consistency across the codebase while respecting the context of different file types and code structures. The tool has been tested with the ollama-tag-cli to t2p conversion use case and proves to be effective in maintaining context-appropriate replacements.
