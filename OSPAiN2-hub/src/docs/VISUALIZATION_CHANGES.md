# Visualization Component Changes

## Overview

The 3D visualization components have been temporarily removed and replaced with simplified JSON-based visualizations to reduce complexity and improve stability. This document outlines the changes made and how to work with the new components.

## Changes Made

1. Removed Three.js dependencies and all 3D rendering code
2. Replaced real-time WebSocket connections with simple API endpoint
3. Created static JSON-based visualizations for knowledge patterns
4. Simplified the component structure and interfaces

## New API Endpoint

The WebSocket connection for visualization data has been replaced with a RESTful API endpoint:

```
GET /api/visualization/patterns
```

This endpoint returns a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "patterns": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Context Confusion",
      "description": "Model fails to maintain context throughout a conversation",
      "frequency": 75,
      "connections": ["2", "5"]
    },
    // More patterns...
  ],
  "analysis": {
    "typeDistribution": {
      "Context Confusion": 35,
      "Hallucination": 45,
      // More types...
    },
    "frequencyDistribution": {
      "high": 38,
      "medium": 72,
      "low": 35
    },
    "mostCommonPatterns": [...],
    "recentPatterns": [...]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2025-03-13T22:35:03.554Z",
    "source": "static-data",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Updated Components

### MisconceptionPatternGraph3D

The 3D graph component has been replaced with a simple JSON visualization that displays the pattern data in a card-based layout. The component maintains the same interface to ensure compatibility with existing code.

### MisconceptionPatternVisualizer

The visualizer component now uses the simplified graph component and fetches data from the new API endpoint rather than establishing a WebSocket connection.

### useMisconceptionPatterns

The WebSocket-based hook has been replaced with a simpler hook that returns static data and doesn't require a WebSocket endpoint parameter.

## How to Use

The updated components can be used in the same way as before:

```tsx
import MisconceptionPatternVisualizer from '../components/visualization/MisconceptionPatternVisualizer';

// Static data or data from API
const patterns = [...];

// In your component
<MisconceptionPatternVisualizer
  patterns={patterns}
  title="Knowledge Pattern Analysis"
  description="Interactive visualization of knowledge patterns"
/>
```

## Future Plans

The simplified visualization is a temporary solution. Once the core server functionality is stable, we'll reintroduce more advanced visualizations with these improvements:

1. Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
2. Progressive enhancement approach
3. Optimized data loading for larger datasets
4. Multiple visualization types to choose from

## Testing Notes

When testing the visualization components:

1. Make sure the API server is running (`node server.js` from the OSPAiN2-hub directory)
2. Verify you can access `/api/visualization/patterns` endpoint
3. Check that the KnowledgeVisualizationPage loads without errors
4. Confirm that pattern selection and detail viewing work properly
