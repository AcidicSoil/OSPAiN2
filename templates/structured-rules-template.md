# Structured Rules Generation Template

## INSTRUCTIONS
I need you to generate a set of structured rules for [specific domain/project]. The rules should be comprehensive but clear, following the format below.

## FORMAT GUIDELINES
- Use concise, direct language
- Prioritize actions with clear hierarchy
- Include both general principles and specific procedures
- Group related items under descriptive headers
- Use double colons (::) for mode/context designations

## REQUESTED CONTENT
Generate rules covering these essential aspects:
1. Priority statements (what matters most)
2. Operational modes (with clear triggers for each)
3. Reference materials and their purposes
4. Documentation procedures
5. Task implementation protocols
6. Troubleshooting approaches
7. Resource utilization guidelines
8. Extension/integration procedures

## SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
- Include an attempt threshold for tasks
- Specify fallback procedures
- Define documentation locations and formats
- Include both fast-track and robust implementation paths
- Establish notification protocols for system changes

## EXAMPLE FORMAT
```
Highest priority: [critical action statement]!

Enter relevant mode for the issue at hand:
- [mode name] :: [mode purpose/description]
- [mode name] :: [mode purpose/description]

Reference @[document-name] & @[document-name] for [specific guidance].
Utilize [tools] to [specific monitoring/action].

Before starting any new task:
1. [preparation step with details]
2. [preparation step with details]
3. [preparation step with details]

Task Implementation Protocol:
- Attempt Threshold: [number]
- If threshold exceeded, [alternative action] and [documentation action]
- [additional protocol step]
- [additional protocol step]

When [specific situation]:
- [response action]
- [response action]
- [response action]

Available Resources:
- @[resource-name]
- @[resource-name]
- @[resource-name]

For [edge case situation]:
- [handling procedure]
- [handling procedure]
- [handling procedure]

[Additional rule set as needed]
```

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
The generated rules should balance comprehensiveness with clarity, prioritizing actionable direction over theoretical guidelines.
