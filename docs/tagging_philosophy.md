# Ollama Ecosystem Tagging Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Organization
- Tags are organized in a tree-like structure
- Three main levels: project, module, and feature
- Each level provides increasing specificity
- Clear parent-child relationships between tags

### 2. Semantic Relationships
- Tags capture meaning beyond simple categorization
- Related concepts are linked through semantic connections
- Enables discovery of relevant context across the ecosystem
- Supports natural language queries and fuzzy matching

### 3. Temporal Context
- Tags maintain historical context
- Version history is preserved
- Changes are tracked with timestamps
- Evolution of components is documented

### 4. Relational Context
- Tags establish connections between ecosystem components
- Dependencies are explicitly marked
- Integration points are documented
- Cross-component relationships are preserved

### 5. Scalability
- Tagging system grows with the ecosystem
- New tag types can be added as needed
- Existing relationships can be extended
- Performance scales with size

## Tag Types

### Project Tags
- Highest level of organization
- Represent major ecosystem components
- Example: `project:ollama-voice`, `project:ollama-hub`

### Module Tags
- Mid-level organization
- Represent functional units within projects
- Example: `module:speech-recognition`, `module:model-management`

### Feature Tags
- Lowest level of organization
- Represent specific functionality
- Example: `feature:wake-word-detection`, `feature:model-optimization`

## Relationships

### Parent-Child
- Projects contain modules
- Modules contain features
- Clear inheritance of context

### Peer
- Related components at the same level
- Shared dependencies or interactions
- Integration points

### Cross-Level
- Direct relationships between different levels
- Skip-level connections when relevant
- Maintain context across boundaries

## Context Management

### Scope Control
- Retrieve context at appropriate level
- Filter by project, module, or feature
- Control depth of context traversal

### Historical Context
- Track changes over time
- Maintain version history
- Document evolution of components

### Semantic Context
- Find related components
- Natural language queries
- Fuzzy matching for discovery

## Best Practices

### 1. Tag Creation
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Follow naming conventions
- Include relevant metadata
- Document relationships

### 2. Tag Maintenance
- Keep relationships updated
- Prune obsolete tags
- Maintain historical records
- Review and refactor periodically

### 3. Context Retrieval
- Use appropriate scope
- Consider depth requirements
- Include relevant history
- Apply semantic matching when needed

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Cache frequently accessed context
- Use efficient queries
- Implement pagination for large results
- Monitor system resources

## Integration with Small Models

### 1. Context Optimization
- Provide relevant context only
- Filter unnecessary information
- Maintain semantic relationships
- Enable efficient retrieval

### 2. Memory Management
- Cache frequently used context
- Implement LRU caching
- Clear outdated cache entries
- Monitor memory usage

### 3. Scaling Capabilities
- Enhance model understanding
- Provide historical context
- Enable semantic search
- Support decision making

## Example Usage

```bash
# Retrieve project-level context
tag context retrieve --scope=project --depth=1

# Get feature context with history
tag context retrieve --scope=feature --history

# Semantic search across all levels
tag context retrieve --semantic-match="speech recognition"

# Export context in different formats
tag context retrieve --format=yaml --scope=module
```

## Future Considerations

### 1. Extended Functionality
- Advanced semantic matching
- Machine learning integration
- Automated relationship discovery
- Context prediction

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Improved caching strategies
- Better query optimization
- Distributed context storage
- Load balancing

### 3. Integration Enhancements
- Better model integration
- Enhanced context sharing
- Automated context updates
- Real-time synchronization
