# Schedule Flexibility Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for managing schedule flexibility in the OSPAiN2-Hub frontend rebuild project. It outlines how to effectively use extra time when ahead of schedule and how to prioritize tasks.

## Schedule Tracking

The project schedule is tracked in [progress.md](./progress.md), which includes a Schedule Variance counter. This counter indicates how many days ahead or behind schedule the project is at any given point.

## When Ahead of Schedule

When the Schedule Variance shows the project is ahead of schedule, use the following decision tree to allocate the extra time:

### Priority 1: Critical Path Acceleration

1. Begin the next phase's critical path tasks early
2. Focus on items that could potentially become bottlenecks
3. Work on tasks with external dependencies to provide buffer time

### Priority 2: Quality Improvements

1. Increase test coverage beyond minimum requirements
2. Improve component documentation
3. Perform additional browser/device compatibility testing
4. Enhance accessibility features

### Priority 3: Opportunity Tasks

When significantly ahead of schedule (3+ days), consider implementing these opportunity tasks:

| Task | Difficulty | Value | Dependencies | Time Estimate |
|------|------------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Animation Library Integration | Medium | High | None | 1-2 days |
| Dark/Light Theme Implementation | Medium | High | Color system | 1-2 days |
| Advanced Filtering for Task Management | Medium | Medium | Basic filtering | 1-2 days |
| Keyboard Shortcuts System | Low | Medium | None | 0.5-1 day |
| Enhanced Accessibility | Medium | High | Base components | 1-3 days |
| Storybook Documentation | Medium | Medium | Component library | 2-3 days |
| Performance Monitoring | Medium | Medium | Base application | 1-2 days |
| User Preferences System | Medium | Medium | State management | 1-2 days |
| Offline Support | High | Medium | API integration | 3-4 days |
| Data Export Functionality | Medium | Low | Data models | 1-2 days |

## Task Jumping Guidelines

When jumping between tasks out of sequence, follow these guidelines:

### Do's

- ✅ Document the jump in the progress tracker
- ✅ Complete any dependencies before jumping to a task
- ✅ Ensure the baseline functionality is solid before adding enhancements
- ✅ Create feature branches for out-of-sequence work
- ✅ Update the team on changes to work priorities
- ✅ Consider impacts on integration testing

### Don'ts

- ❌ Jump to tasks with incomplete dependencies
- ❌ Start multiple out-of-sequence tasks simultaneously
- ❌ Skip code reviews for out-of-sequence work
- ❌ Neglect documentation for implemented features
- ❌ Allow scope creep when implementing opportunity tasks

## Impact Assessment

Before allocating extra time to an opportunity task, perform this quick impact assessment:

1. **Value Check**: Will this immediately benefit users or developers?
2. **Integration Risk**: How likely is this to conflict with upcoming work?
3. **Maintenance Cost**: Will this add significant maintenance overhead?
4. **Technical Debt**: Does this follow best practices or create shortcuts?
5. **Testing Impact**: Can this be thoroughly tested in the available time?

## Schedule Recovery

If the project falls behind schedule after being ahead, follow these steps:

1. Immediately return to the critical path
2. Put any in-progress opportunity tasks on hold
3. Document the current state of paused work
4. Assess the cause of the schedule slippage
5. Update the progress tracker with the new schedule variance
6. Adjust remaining estimates if necessary

## Tracking Format

When tracking out-of-sequence work in the progress document, use this format:

```markdown
#### Opportunity Task: [Task Name]
- **Started**: [Date] (when [X] days ahead of schedule)
- **Status**: [Complete/In Progress/On Hold]
- **Time Invested**: [Days]
- **Remaining Work**: [Description]
- **Impact**: [Benefits realized]
```

## Review Process

Schedule flexibility should be reviewed weekly to ensure effective use of time:

1. Update the Schedule Variance counter
2. Assess current opportunity tasks
3. Reprioritize based on current project state
4. Document decisions in the progress tracker

This approach provides structure for efficiently using schedule flexibility while maintaining focus on project priorities.
