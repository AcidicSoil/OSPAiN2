## Project Overview

The OSPAiN2-Hub frontend rebuild project aims to modernize the user interface and improve the developer experience by replacing the existing Create React App-based frontend with a modern stack.

### Key Goals

1. **Improve Developer Experience** - Faster builds, better tooling, and improved maintainability
2. **Enhance Performance** - Optimized bundling, better caching, and improved rendering
3. **Modernize Architecture** - Clean component structure, type safety, and maintainable state management
4. **Improve User Experience** - Responsive design, dark mode support, and better accessibility

### Technical Stack

- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Library**: React
- **Type System**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Data Fetching**: React Query + Axios
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

## Current Status

The project is currently in the UI Components phase, with the following completed:

- ‚úÖ Documentation and Planning
- ‚úÖ Project Setup
- ‚úÖ Core Infrastructure
- üü° UI Components (in progress)
- üî¥ Feature Implementation (not started)

**Schedule Status**: Currently 1 day ahead of schedule. See [Schedule Tracking](./progress.md#schedule-tracking) for details.

## Integration with Development Modes

The frontend rebuild project integrates with our development modes framework:

- üé® **Design Mode**: Wireframes and UI/UX design (completed)
- üîß **Engineering Mode**: Core infrastructure implementation (current phase)
- üß™ **Testing Mode**: Component testing and integration testing (upcoming)
- üì¶ **Deployment Mode**: Build optimization and CI/CD setup (planned)
- üîç **Maintenance Mode**: Documentation and ongoing improvements (continuous)

## Optimization Strategy

The project follows a proactive optimization approach outlined in [Predictive Optimization Strategies](./predictive-optimization.md). This framework helps identify and address performance issues early by:

- Monitoring key performance metrics and code quality indicators
- Predicting optimization needs based on development phases
- Implementing just-in-time optimizations with measurable impact
- Recognizing emergent patterns that signal optimization opportunities

## Getting Started

For developers looking to contribute to the frontend rebuild project:

1. Review the [Architecture](./architecture.md) document to understand the project structure
2. Follow the [Setup](./setup.md) instructions to set up your development environment
3. Check the [Progress](./progress.md) document to see what's currently being worked on
4. Review the [Wireframes](./wireframes.md) to understand the planned UI/UX

## Task Tracking

Tasks for the frontend rebuild are tracked in the master-todo.md file under the "Frontend Framework Migration" section. See [Updates](./updates.md) for the latest status.
