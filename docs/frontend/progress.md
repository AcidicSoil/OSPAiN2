**Schedule Variance**: Positive numbers indicate days ahead of schedule, negative numbers indicate days behind schedule.

**Current Schedule Status**: 
- **3 days ahead of schedule**
- Extra time can be allocated to:
  - Implementing additional UI components beyond the original scope
  - Starting Phase 3 tasks early
  - Adding stretch goal features from the backlog
  - Enhancing the predictive optimization framework

**Opportunity Tasks** (when ahead of schedule):
1. Add animation library integration

3. Create advanced filtering capabilities for task management
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. Improve accessibility features beyond minimum requirements
6. âœ… Create predictive optimization framework for automated performance tracking
