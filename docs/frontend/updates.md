### Frontend Framework Migration
- ðŸŸ¡ **P1**: Rebuild OSPAiN2-hub Frontend with Modern Stack
  - Purpose: Replace Create React App with Vite, improve architecture, and enhance developer experience
  - Tasks:
    - ðŸŸ¢ Documentation and Planning:
      - âœ… Created comprehensive architecture documentation
      - âœ… Designed wireframes for all main screens
      - âœ… Developed detailed implementation plan with timeline
      - âœ… Set up progress tracking system
    - ðŸŸ¢ Project Setup:
      - âœ… Created project directory structure
      - âœ… Set up Vite with React and TypeScript
      - âœ… Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
      - âœ… Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
      - âœ… Configured testing environment with Vitest
    - ðŸŸ¢ Core Infrastructure:
      - âœ… Implemented state management with Zustand
      - âœ… Created API client service with Axios
      - âœ… Set up React Query for data fetching
      - âœ… Implemented routing with React Router
    - ðŸŸ¡ UI Components:
      - âœ… Created MainLayout component
      - âœ… Implemented Header component with search and user menu
      - âœ… Built Sidebar component with navigation
      - âœ… Created placeholder pages for all main sections
      - ðŸ”´ Implement theme switching functionality
      - ðŸ”´ Add responsive design adjustments
      - ðŸ”´ Create error handling utilities
    - ðŸ”´ Feature Implementation:
      - âœ… Implemented basic Dashboard layout with mock data
      - âœ… Created T2P Engine interface with command input
      - âœ… Added placeholder interfaces for Agents and Tasks
      - âœ… Implemented Settings page with theme switching
      - ðŸ”´ Develop core UI component library
      - ðŸ”´ Create component documentation
      - ðŸ”´ Write unit tests for components
  - Implementation notes:
    - Using Vite instead of Next.js for faster development experience
    - Zustand for state management instead of tRPC
    - Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent design system
    - React Query for data fetching and caching
    - Comprehensive documentation in docs/frontend/ directory
  - Technical benefits:
    - Elimination of CRA dependency conflicts and deprecation warnings
    - Modern tech stack with active maintenance and updates
    - Improved performance via Vite optimizations
    - Better component modularity and code organization
    - Simplified state management with Zustand
  - Timeline:
    - Documentation and Planning: Completed
    - Project Setup: Completed
    - Core Infrastructure: Completed
    - UI Components: In progress (ETA: 7 days)
    - Feature Implementation: Not started (ETA: 14 days)
    - Total estimate: 25-30 days from start to completion
  - PRIORITY: Critical - Blocks further frontend development due to dependency issues
```

## Documentation Structure Updates

The frontend documentation is now organized in the following structure:

- `docs/frontend/architecture.md` - Technical architecture, component structure, and design patterns
- `docs/frontend/wireframes.md` - UI/UX wireframes and layout designs
- `docs/frontend/setup.md` - Setup instructions and development environment configuration
- `docs/frontend/progress.md` - Progress tracking and current status
- `docs/frontend/summary.md` - Project overview and key accomplishments

Additional frontend-related documents in the root docs directory:

- `docs/frontend-implementation-plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan and timeline
- `docs/frontend-setup.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `docs/frontend-wireframes.md` - Detailed wireframes for all screens
- `docs/frontend-rebuild.md` - Overall rebuild strategy and architecture

## Project Summary

The OSPAiN2-Hub frontend rebuild project aims to modernize the user interface and improve the developer experience by replacing the existing Create React App-based frontend with a modern stack using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
