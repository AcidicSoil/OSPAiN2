## Document Metadata

- **Development Mode**: ðŸ”§ Engineering Mode

## Executive Summary

The Documentation Standards Framework establishes a comprehensive system for creating, organizing, and maintaining documentation in the Ollama Ecosystem project. It introduces standardized templates, a consistent directory structure, and integrates with the project's horizon management approach to ensure documentation evolves alongside the codebase.

## Problem Statement

The Ollama Ecosystem project lacks standardized documentation practices, leading to inconsistent information quality, difficulty in finding relevant information, and challenges in knowledge transfer. Without a structured documentation approach, the project risks knowledge silos, reduced contributor onboarding efficiency, and increased maintenance challenges.

## User Personas

- **Developer Persona**: Amir, Software Engineer

  - Goals: Quickly understand code purpose and implementation details to make changes efficiently
  - Pain Points: Currently spends too much time reverse-engineering code to understand its purpose and design decisions

- **Project Manager Persona**: Sophia, Project Manager

  - Goals: Track project progress, understand feature scope, and communicate status to stakeholders
  - Pain Points: Struggles to find comprehensive and updated information about feature requirements and status

- **New Contributor Persona**: Taylor, Open Source Contributor
  - Goals: Understand project structure and contribute meaningful code without extensive hand-holding
  - Pain Points: Faces steep learning curve due to scattered and inconsistent documentation

## Success Metrics

- 90% of new features have complete documentation following the standards
- 50% reduction in time spent by new contributors to understand the codebase
- 75% of developers report improved ability to find relevant documentation
- 100% of H1 features have complete documentation according to the framework

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Requirement 1: Provide standardized templates for all required document types (PRD, TDD, PHA, PHD, etc.)
- Requirement 2: Establish a consistent directory structure for organizing documentation
- Requirement 3: Integrate documentation processes with horizon management framework
- Requirement 4: Define clear documentation ownership and review processes

### Secondary Functionality

- Requirement 5: Provide quality checklists for documentation review
- Requirement 6: Establish naming conventions for documentation files
- Requirement 7: Support cross-referencing between related documents
- Requirement 8: Create documentation lifecycle management guidelines

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Documentation structure should support quick retrieval of information
- Security: Documentation should clearly identify sensitive information handling
- Usability: Templates should be easy to use with clear guidance on completion
- Scalability: Structure should accommodate project growth without reorganization

## User Flows

1. New feature development documentation flow:

   - Developer creates PRD using template in vision/prd directory
   - After PRD approval, engineer creates TDD using template in implementation/tdd directory
   - Security team creates PHA based on PRD and TDD
   - After implementation, team creates PHD for knowledge transfer

2. Documentation discovery flow:
   - User navigates to docs directory
   - User reads README.md to understand structure
   - User navigates to relevant subdirectory based on information need
   - User finds documentation by feature name and type

## UI/UX Requirements

- UI Element 1: Directory structure should use clear naming and README files for navigation
- UI Element 2: Templates should have consistent header metadata for easy identification
- UI Element 3: Documentation should use consistent Markdown formatting for readability
- UI Element 4: Integration with project tools should maintain consistent document organization

## Technical Considerations

- Dependency 1: Integration with existing horizon management framework
- Technical constraint 1: Documentation must be stored in version control alongside code
- Technical constraint 2: Documentation must be accessible offline and without special tools

## Testing Requirements

- Test scenario 1: Verify all templates are accessible and correctly formatted
- Test scenario 2: Verify README files accurately represent directory contents
- Test scenario 3: Verify cross-references between documents are valid
- Test scenario 4: Verify documentation meets established quality metrics

## Timeline and Milestones

- Milestone 1: June 28, 2024 - Initial framework and templates defined
- Milestone 2: July 5, 2024 - Complete set of templates created
- Milestone 3: July 12, 2024 - Documentation process integration with horizon management
- Milestone 4: July 19, 2024 - First complete documentation set for a feature

## Stakeholders

- Stakeholder 1: Engineering Team - Primary creators and consumers of documentation
- Stakeholder 2: Project Management - Uses documentation for tracking and planning
- Stakeholder 3: Community Contributors - Relies on documentation for understanding

## Open Questions

- Question 1: Should we implement automated documentation quality checks?
- Question 2: How do we ensure documentation remains updated as code evolves?
